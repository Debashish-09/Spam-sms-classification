# Spam-sms-classification
Built an SMS spam detection model using NLP and machine learning. Preprocessed text messages, extracted features using TF-IDF, and trained classifiers like Naive Bayes and SVM to accurately distinguish between spam and ham messages.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to help filter out unwanted messages (spam) from genuine ones by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **Source**: UCI SMS Spam Collection
- **Total Messages**: 5,574
- **Classes**: Spam (1), Ham (0)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- nltk (for text cleaning)
- scikit-learn (for modeling and evaluation)
- TF-IDF for feature extraction

---

## 🔄 Process

1. Load and clean the text data  
2. Convert text to numeric features using TF-IDF  
3. Train models: Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression  
4. Evaluate with accuracy and F1-score  

---

## 📊 Results

- **Naive Bayes** gave the best balance of speed and accuracy
- Achieved over **XX% accuracy** on test data

*Update metrics once evaluated.*
